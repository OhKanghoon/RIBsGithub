// Debug Information Format
//
// The type of debug information to produce.
//
// * DWARF: Object files and linked products will use DWARF as the debug information
// format. [dwarf]
// * DWARF with dSYM File: Object files and linked products will use DWARF as the debug
// information format, and Xcode will also produce a dSYM file containing the debug
// information from the individual object files (except that a dSYM file is not needed
// and will not be created for static library or object file products). [dwarf-with-dsym]
